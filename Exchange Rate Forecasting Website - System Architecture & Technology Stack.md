## System Components

The exchange rate forecasting system consists of several interconnected components, each responsible for specific functionality within the overall architecture. These components work together to provide a comprehensive solution for data collection, processing, analysis, and presentation.

### Data Collection Service

The Data Collection Service serves as the primary interface between external data sources and the internal system. This component implements multiple data collectors that operate on different schedules and handle various data formats. The Exchange Rate Collector interfaces with the ExchangeRate-API to retrieve current and historical currency exchange rates, implementing retry logic and error handling to ensure data consistency. The News Collector connects to NewsAPI to fetch real-time financial news articles, applying filters to focus on content relevant to currency markets and economic indicators.

The service implements a robust scheduling system using Celery beat scheduler to coordinate data collection activities. Exchange rate data is collected every hour during market hours and every four hours during off-market periods, while news articles are collected continuously with a polling interval of five minutes. Each collector maintains its own configuration settings, including API keys, rate limits, and retry policies.

Data validation and cleaning occur within this service before forwarding information to downstream components. The service checks for data completeness, validates data formats, and handles missing values according to predefined business rules. All collected data is timestamped and tagged with source information to enable traceability and quality monitoring.

### Sentiment Analysis Service

The Sentiment Analysis Service processes incoming news articles to extract sentiment indicators that influence exchange rate predictions. This service integrates with Google Cloud Natural Language API to perform accurate sentiment analysis while also implementing fallback mechanisms using open-source libraries for cost optimization and redundancy.

The service receives news articles from the Data Collection Service through a message queue and processes them in near real-time. Each article undergoes preprocessing steps including text cleaning, language detection, and relevance scoring. Articles are then analyzed for overall sentiment, entity-specific sentiment, and emotional indicators that may impact currency markets.

The service maintains a sentiment scoring system that normalizes results from different analysis methods and creates composite sentiment indicators. These indicators are aggregated across different time windows (hourly, daily, weekly) and currency pairs to create features for the machine learning models. The service also implements sentiment trend analysis to identify sudden changes in market sentiment that may signal significant price movements.

### Machine Learning Service

The Machine Learning Service encompasses the core predictive capabilities of the system, implementing multiple forecasting models and managing the entire machine learning lifecycle from training to inference. This service maintains separate model pipelines for different currency pairs and time horizons, allowing for specialized optimization based on specific market characteristics.

The service implements a feature engineering pipeline that combines exchange rate data, sentiment indicators, technical indicators, and external economic factors into comprehensive feature sets. Feature engineering includes time-based features such as moving averages and volatility measures, sentiment-based features derived from news analysis, and calendar-based features that account for market holidays and economic events.

Model training occurs on a scheduled basis using historical data, with separate models for short-term (1-24 hours), medium-term (1-7 days), and long-term (1-4 weeks) predictions. The service implements ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple algorithms including linear regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and neural networks. Model performance is continuously monitored, and automatic retraining is triggered when performance degrades below acceptable thresholds.

Real-time inference capabilities enable the service to generate predictions on-demand as new data becomes available. The service maintains model versioning and A/B testing capabilities to evaluate new model versions against existing ones before deployment to production.

### API Gateway Service

The API Gateway Service provides a unified interface for external clients to access system functionality while implementing security, rate limiting, and monitoring capabilities. This service handles authentication and authorization for different user types, from individual users to enterprise clients with varying access levels and rate limits.

The gateway implements RESTful API endpoints for retrieving exchange rate predictions, historical data, sentiment analysis results, and system status information. WebSocket endpoints enable real-time data streaming for applications requiring live updates. The service also provides GraphQL endpoints for clients that need flexible data querying capabilities.

Rate limiting is implemented on a per-user and per-endpoint basis, with different limits for authenticated and anonymous users. The service maintains API usage statistics and implements fair usage policies to ensure system stability. Caching mechanisms reduce load on backend services by serving frequently requested data from Redis cache.

### Real-Time Processing Engine

The Real-Time Processing Engine coordinates the flow of data through the system and ensures that new information is processed and reflected in predictions with minimal latency. This component implements event-driven architecture patterns using Apache Kafka or similar message queue systems to handle high-volume data streams.

The engine processes incoming data events in the order they arrive, applying business rules to determine which components need to be notified of changes. When new exchange rate data arrives, the engine triggers immediate recalculation of short-term predictions. When significant news events are detected, the engine initiates sentiment analysis and model updates.

The engine implements complex event processing capabilities to detect patterns and correlations across different data streams. This includes identifying news events that historically correlate with exchange rate movements and triggering alerts when similar patterns are detected in real-time data.

### User Interface Service

The User Interface Service provides the web-based frontend that users interact with to access predictions, view historical data, and configure alerts. This service is built using React and implements a responsive design that works across desktop and mobile devices.

The interface includes multiple dashboard views tailored to different user types and use cases. The main dashboard provides an overview of current exchange rates, recent predictions, and market sentiment indicators. Detailed analysis views allow users to explore historical trends, compare different currency pairs, and analyze the impact of news events on exchange rates.

Real-time updates are implemented using WebSocket connections to ensure that users see the latest information without needing to refresh their browsers. The interface includes interactive charts and visualizations that allow users to explore data at different time scales and granularities.

## Data Flow Architecture

The data flow architecture describes how information moves through the system from initial collection to final presentation to users. Understanding this flow is crucial for optimizing performance, ensuring data consistency, and maintaining system reliability.

### Primary Data Flow

The primary data flow begins with the Data Collection Service retrieving information from external APIs according to predefined schedules. Exchange rate data flows directly into MongoDB Cloud where it is stored in time-series collections optimized for temporal queries. Simultaneously, news articles are collected and immediately forwarded to the Sentiment Analysis Service for processing.

The Sentiment Analysis Service processes news articles and generates sentiment scores that are stored alongside the original articles in MongoDB. These sentiment scores are then aggregated into time-based features that serve as inputs to the machine learning models. The aggregation process creates multiple views of sentiment data at different temporal resolutions to support various prediction horizons.

The Machine Learning Service continuously monitors for new data and triggers feature engineering processes when sufficient new information is available. Features are computed by combining exchange rate data, sentiment indicators, and external factors into comprehensive datasets. These features are then used to generate predictions using pre-trained models, with results stored in MongoDB for quick retrieval.

### Real-Time Data Flow

Real-time data flow handles the immediate processing of incoming information to provide users with the most current predictions and insights. When new exchange rate data arrives, it is immediately stored in MongoDB and triggers a cascade of processing activities throughout the system.

The Real-Time Processing Engine receives notifications of new data and determines which components need to be updated. For exchange rate updates, this typically includes recalculating technical indicators, updating short-term prediction models, and notifying connected users through WebSocket connections.

News articles follow a more complex real-time flow due to the need for sentiment analysis. Articles are immediately queued for sentiment processing while basic metadata is stored in MongoDB. As sentiment analysis completes, the results trigger feature recalculation and potential model updates if the sentiment represents a significant change from recent patterns.

### Batch Processing Flow

Batch processing handles computationally intensive tasks that don't require immediate completion, such as model training, historical data analysis, and system maintenance tasks. These processes are scheduled during off-peak hours to minimize impact on real-time operations.

Model training batch jobs retrieve historical data from MongoDB, perform feature engineering on large datasets, and train new model versions using distributed computing resources. The training process includes cross-validation, hyperparameter optimization, and performance evaluation against holdout datasets.

Data archival and cleanup batch processes manage the lifecycle of stored data, moving older records to long-term storage and removing temporary data that is no longer needed. These processes ensure that the system maintains optimal performance while preserving historical data for analysis and compliance purposes.

### Error Handling and Recovery Flow

The system implements comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms to ensure data consistency and system availability even when individual components experience failures. Each component includes circuit breaker patterns that prevent cascading failures and graceful degradation mechanisms that maintain core functionality during partial outages.

When external API calls fail, the system implements exponential backoff retry strategies with maximum retry limits to avoid overwhelming external services. Failed data collection attempts are logged and queued for retry during the next collection cycle. Critical failures trigger alerts to system administrators while the system continues operating with cached or estimated data.

Data consistency is maintained through transactional operations where possible and eventual consistency patterns where immediate consistency is not required. The system includes data validation checkpoints throughout the processing pipeline to detect and correct inconsistencies before they propagate to downstream components.


## Database Design

The database design leverages MongoDB Cloud's document-based storage model to efficiently handle the diverse data types and access patterns required by the exchange rate forecasting system. The schema design balances query performance, storage efficiency, and scalability requirements while maintaining data consistency and integrity.

### Exchange Rate Data Collection

The exchange rate data is stored in a time-series optimized collection structure that supports efficient queries across different time ranges and currency pairs. The primary collection `exchange_rates` uses a compound index on currency pair and timestamp to enable fast retrieval of historical data and real-time updates.

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "base_currency": "USD",
  "target_currency": "EUR",
  "rate": 0.8456,
  "timestamp": ISODate("2025-07-08T12:00:00Z"),
  "source": "exchangerate-api",
  "bid": 0.8454,
  "ask": 0.8458,
  "volume": 1250000,
  "metadata": {
    "collection_time": ISODate("2025-07-08T12:01:15Z"),
    "api_response_time": 245,
    "data_quality_score": 0.98
  }
}
```

The collection implements a bucketing strategy where data is partitioned by time periods to optimize query performance and enable efficient data lifecycle management. Indexes are created on frequently queried fields including currency pairs, timestamp ranges, and source identifiers. The design supports both point-in-time queries for specific rates and range queries for historical analysis.

### News Articles and Content Storage

News articles are stored in a dedicated collection that accommodates the variable structure of news content while maintaining efficient search and retrieval capabilities. The `news_articles` collection includes full-text search indexes to enable content-based queries and sentiment analysis workflows.

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "title": "Federal Reserve Signals Interest Rate Changes",
  "content": "Full article content...",
  "source": {
    "name": "Reuters",
    "url": "https://reuters.com/article/...",
    "api_source": "newsapi"
  },
  "published_at": ISODate("2025-07-08T10:30:00Z"),
  "collected_at": ISODate("2025-07-08T10:35:12Z"),
  "language": "en",

  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "Federal Reserve",
      "type": "organization",
      "relevance": 0.95
    }
  ],
  "sentiment": {
    "overall_score": 0.15,
    "magnitude": 0.8,
    "processed_at": ISODate("2025-07-08T10:36:45Z"),
    "processor": "google-nlp",
    "entity_sentiments": [
      {
        "entity": "Federal Reserve",
        "sentiment": 0.12,
        "magnitude": 0.7
      }
    ]
  },
  "relevance_scores": {
    "USD_EUR": 0.85,
    "USD_GBP": 0.78,
    "USD_JPY": 0.82
  }
}
```

The news collection implements text indexing for content search and compound indexes for time-based and source-based queries. The sentiment analysis results are embedded within the document to reduce query complexity and improve performance for machine learning feature extraction.

### Machine Learning Models and Predictions

Machine learning models and their predictions are stored in separate collections that support model versioning, performance tracking, and prediction history. The `ml_models` collection maintains metadata about trained models, while the `predictions` collection stores forecasting results with associated confidence intervals and feature importance scores.

```javascript

}
```

### User Management and Authentication

User data and authentication information are stored in collections that support different user types and access levels. The design includes support for API key management, usage tracking, and subscription management for different service tiers.

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId,
  "username": "trader_john",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password_hash": "bcrypt_hash_here",

  "last_login": ISODate("2025-07-08T09:30:00Z")
}
```

### Indexing Strategy

The database implements a comprehensive indexing strategy to optimize query performance across different access patterns. Primary indexes are created on frequently queried fields, while compound indexes support complex queries that filter on multiple criteria.

Exchange rate data uses compound indexes on `(base_currency, target_currency, timestamp)` to support time-series queries and `(timestamp, source)` for data quality monitoring. News articles implement text indexes on title and content fields for full-text search, along with compound indexes on `(published_at, categories)` and `(sentiment.overall_score, published_at)` for sentiment-based queries.

Machine learning collections use indexes on model metadata fields and prediction timestamps to support model performance analysis and prediction retrieval. User collections implement unique indexes on username and email fields, with compound indexes on subscription and usage tracking fields.

## API Design

The API design follows RESTful principles while incorporating real-time capabilities through WebSocket connections and GraphQL endpoints for flexible data querying. The API provides comprehensive access to system functionality while maintaining security, performance, and usability standards.

### Authentication and Authorization

The API implements a multi-layered authentication system that supports different access methods for various client types. API key authentication is used for programmatic access, while JWT tokens support web application sessions. OAuth 2.0 integration enables third-party application access with user consent.

```http
# API Key Authentication
GET /api/v1/predictions/USD_EUR
Authorization: Bearer ak_1234567890abcdef
Content-Type: application/json

# JWT Token Authentication
GET /api/v1/user/preferences
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
Content-Type: application/json
```

Authorization is implemented using role-based access control (RBAC) with different permission levels for various user types. Free tier users have access to basic prediction endpoints with rate limiting, while premium users can access historical data, detailed analytics, and real-time streaming endpoints.

### Exchange Rate Endpoints
