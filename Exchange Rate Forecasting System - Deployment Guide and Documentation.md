## Pre-deployment Setup

Before deploying the Exchange Rate Forecasting System, several preparatory steps must be completed to ensure a smooth deployment process. This section covers the essential setup procedures that must be performed in the correct sequence.

### Environment Preparation

The deployment environment must be properly configured with all necessary dependencies and security measures. Begin by updating the operating system and installing essential packages that will be required throughout the deployment process.

For Ubuntu-based systems, execute the following commands to update the package repository and install fundamental dependencies. These packages provide the foundation for running Python applications, Node.js services, and database connectivity.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl wget git build-essential software-properties-common
sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo apt install -y nginx redis-server
sudo apt install -y certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

Create dedicated system users for running the application services. This security best practice ensures that application processes run with minimal privileges and reduces the attack surface in case of security breaches.

```bash
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false exchange-api
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false exchange-frontend
sudo mkdir -p /opt/exchange-forecast
sudo chown exchange-api:exchange-api /opt/exchange-forecast
```

### Security Configuration

Implement essential security measures before deploying the application. Configure the firewall to allow only necessary network traffic and establish secure communication channels for all external connections.

```bash
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow 6379/tcp  # Redis (internal only)
```

Generate SSL certificates for secure HTTPS communication. Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates or configure custom certificates provided by your organization.

```bash
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com -d api.your-domain.com
```

### Database Preparation

Prepare the local Redis instance for caching and session management. Redis will be used to store temporary data, cache frequently accessed information, and manage user sessions for improved performance.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable redis-server
sudo systemctl start redis-server
sudo redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
```

Configure Redis security settings by editing the configuration file and setting appropriate access controls.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf
```

Add the following security configurations:

```
requirepass your-secure-redis-password
bind 127.0.0.1
protected-mode yes
```

Restart Redis to apply the security settings:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart redis-server
```



## MongoDB Cloud Configuration

MongoDB Atlas provides the cloud database infrastructure for the Exchange Rate Forecasting System. Proper configuration of the MongoDB Atlas cluster is crucial for system performance, security, and scalability. This section provides detailed instructions for setting up and configuring MongoDB Atlas for production use.

### Creating MongoDB Atlas Cluster

Begin by creating a MongoDB Atlas account and setting up a new cluster specifically for the exchange rate forecasting application. Navigate to the MongoDB Atlas dashboard and select the appropriate cluster tier based on your expected usage patterns and performance requirements.

For production deployments, choose the M10 tier or higher to ensure adequate performance and storage capacity. The M10 tier provides 2 GB of storage and can handle moderate traffic loads, while higher tiers offer increased performance and storage for larger deployments.

Configure the cluster with the following specifications:
- **Cluster Tier:** M10 or higher for production
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure based on your preference
- **Region:** Select a region closest to your application servers for optimal latency
- **MongoDB Version:** 5.0 or later for best performance and feature support

### Database Security Configuration

Security configuration is paramount for protecting sensitive financial data and ensuring compliance with data protection regulations. MongoDB Atlas provides multiple layers of security that must be properly configured.

**Network Access Configuration:**
Configure IP whitelist to restrict database access to authorized servers only. Add the IP addresses of your application servers to the network access list. For development environments, you may temporarily allow access from anywhere, but production deployments must use specific IP restrictions.

```javascript
// Example IP whitelist configuration
{
  "ipAddress": "203.0.113.0/24",  // Your server subnet
  "comment": "Production application servers"
}
```

**Database User Management:**
Create dedicated database users with appropriate permissions for different application components. Follow the principle of least privilege by granting only the minimum permissions required for each service.

```javascript
// Database user configuration
{
  "username": "exchange_api_user",
  "password": "secure_generated_password",
  "roles": [
    {
      "role": "readWrite",
      "db": "exchange_forecast"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Authentication and Encryption:**
Enable authentication and configure encryption in transit and at rest. MongoDB Atlas provides automatic encryption for data at rest, but you must ensure that all connections use TLS encryption.

### Database Schema Implementation

The database schema must be implemented according to the design specifications outlined in the system architecture documentation. Create the necessary collections and indexes to support optimal query performance.

**Collections Structure:**
```javascript
// Exchange rates collection
db.exchange_rates.createIndex({ "pair": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.exchange_rates.createIndex({ "timestamp": -1 })

// News articles collection
db.news_articles.createIndex({ "relevance_pairs": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.news_articles.createIndex({ "sentiment": 1, "timestamp": -1 })

// Predictions collection
db.predictions.createIndex({ "pair": 1, "model": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
db.predictions.createIndex({ "timestamp": -1 })

// Model performance collection
db.model_performance.createIndex({ "model": 1, "timestamp": -1 })
```

**Data Validation Rules:**
Implement schema validation to ensure data integrity and consistency across all collections.

```javascript
// Exchange rates validation schema
db.createCollection("exchange_rates", {
  validator: {
    $jsonSchema: {
      bsonType: "object",
      required: ["pair", "rate", "timestamp", "source"],
      properties: {
        pair: {
          bsonType: "string",
          pattern: "^[A-Z]{3}/[A-Z]{3}$"
        },
        rate: {
          bsonType: "double",
          minimum: 0
        },
        timestamp: {
          bsonType: "date"
        },
        source: {
          bsonType: "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

## Security Considerations

Security is paramount for the Exchange Rate Forecasting System due to the sensitive nature of financial data and the potential impact of security breaches. This section outlines comprehensive security measures that must be implemented and maintained throughout the system lifecycle.

### Application Security

**Input Validation and Sanitization:**
All user inputs must be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks and data corruption. Implement comprehensive input validation at both the frontend and backend levels to ensure data integrity and system security.

```python
# Backend input validation example
from marshmallow import Schema, fields, validate

class ForecastRequestSchema(Schema):
    pair = fields.Str(required=True, validate=validate.Regexp(r'^[A-Z]{3}/[A-Z]{3}$'))
    model = fields.Str(required=True, validate=validate.OneOf(['ensemble', 'xgboost', 'lstm']))
    horizon = fields.Int(required=True, validate=validate.Range(min=1, max=168))
    
def validate_forecast_request(data):
    schema = ForecastRequestSchema()
    try:
        result = schema.load(data)
        return result, None
    except ValidationError as err:
        return None, err.messages
```

**Authentication and Authorization:**
Implement robust authentication mechanisms using JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times and refresh token rotation. Role-based access control ensures that users can only access features and data appropriate to their authorization level.

```python
# JWT token configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'your-super-secure-secret-key'
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES = timedelta(hours=1)
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRES = timedelta(days=30)

# Role-based access control
from functools import wraps
from flask_jwt_extended import get_jwt_identity, verify_jwt_in_request

def require_role(required_role):
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            verify_jwt_in_request()
            current_user = get_jwt_identity()
            if current_user['role'] != required_role:
                return {'error': 'Insufficient permissions'}, 403
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator

@app.route('/api/admin/retrain-model', methods=['POST'])
@require_role('admin')
def retrain_model():
    # Admin-only functionality
    pass
```

**API Security Headers:**
Configure security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities including XSS, CSRF, and clickjacking attacks.

```python
# Security headers middleware
@app.after_request
def set_security_headers(response):
    response.headers['X-Content-Type-Options'] = 'nosniff'
    response.headers['X-Frame-Options'] = 'DENY'
    response.headers['X-XSS-Protection'] = '1; mode=block'
    response.headers['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
    response.headers['Content-Security-Policy'] = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'"
    return response
```

### Data Security

**Encryption at Rest:**
All sensitive data stored in MongoDB Atlas is encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption. Additional application-level encryption should be implemented for highly sensitive information such as API keys and user credentials.

```python
# Application-level encryption for sensitive data
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import base64

class DataEncryption:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.cipher_suite = Fernet(key)
    
    def encrypt(self, data):
        encrypted_data = self.cipher_suite.encrypt(data.encode())
        return base64.urlsafe_b64encode(encrypted_data).decode()
    
    def decrypt(self, encrypted_data):
        decoded_data = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(encrypted_data.encode())
        decrypted_data = self.cipher_suite.decrypt(decoded_data)
        return decrypted_data.decode()

# Usage for API key storage
encryption = DataEncryption(os.environ['ENCRYPTION_KEY'])
encrypted_api_key = encryption.encrypt(api_key)
```

**Encryption in Transit:**
All network communications must use TLS 1.2 or higher encryption. This includes connections between frontend and backend, backend and database, and all external API communications.

**Data Masking and Anonymization:**
Implement data masking for non-production environments and ensure that personally identifiable information is properly anonymized in logs and debugging output.

### Network Security

**Firewall Configuration:**
Configure network firewalls to allow only necessary traffic and implement network segmentation to isolate different system components.

```bash
# UFW firewall rules
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8 to any port 5000  # Internal API access only
sudo ufw enable
```

**VPN and Private Networks:**
For production deployments, consider using VPN connections or private networks to secure communications between system components and restrict public access to sensitive services.

**DDoS Protection:**
Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure system availability during attack scenarios.

```python
# Rate limiting implementation
from flask_limiter import Limiter
from flask_limiter.util import get_remote_address

limiter = Limiter(
    app,
    key_func=get_remote_address,
    default_limits=["1000 per hour", "100 per minute"]
)

@app.route('/api/forecast', methods=['POST'])
@limiter.limit("10 per minute")
def generate_forecast():
    # Rate-limited endpoint
    pass
```

### Security Monitoring

**Audit Logging:**
Implement comprehensive audit logging to track all system access, data modifications, and security-relevant events.

```python
# Audit logging implementation
import logging
from datetime import datetime

audit_logger = logging.getLogger('audit')
audit_handler = logging.FileHandler('/var/log/exchange-forecast/audit.log')
audit_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
audit_handler.setFormatter(audit_formatter)
audit_logger.addHandler(audit_handler)

def log_audit_event(user_id, action, resource, result):
    audit_logger.info(f"User: {user_id}, Action: {action}, Resource: {resource}, Result: {result}")

# Usage in API endpoints
@app.route('/api/forecast', methods=['POST'])
def generate_forecast():
    user_id = get_jwt_identity()['id']
    try:
        # Forecast generation logic
        result = generate_prediction(data)
        log_audit_event(user_id, 'GENERATE_FORECAST', 'forecast', 'SUCCESS')
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        log_audit_event(user_id, 'GENERATE_FORECAST', 'forecast', f'FAILED: {str(e)}')
        raise
```

**Intrusion Detection:**
Monitor system logs for suspicious activities, failed authentication attempts, and unusual access patterns that may indicate security breaches.

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler('/var/log/exchange-forecast/app.log'),
        logging.StreamHandler()
    ]
)

# Set JSON formatter for file handler
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('/var/log/exchange-forecast/app.log')
file_handler.setFormatter(JSONFormatter())
```

**Log Rotation and Retention:**
Configure log rotation to prevent disk space issues and implement appropriate retention policies.

```bash
# Logrotate configuration
sudo nano /etc/logrotate.d/exchange-forecast

/var/log/exchange-forecast/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 30
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 644 exchange-api exchange-api
    postrotate
        systemctl reload exchange-api
    endscript
}
```

### Maintenance Procedures

**Regular Maintenance Tasks:**
Establish regular maintenance schedules for system updates, security patches, and performance optimization.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Daily maintenance script

# Update system packages
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Clean up old log files
find /var/log/exchange-forecast -name "*.log.*" -mtime +30 -delete

# Restart services if needed
sudo systemctl restart exchange-api
sudo systemctl restart nginx

# Check disk usage
df -h | grep -E "(/$|/var|/opt)"

# Monitor memory usage
free -h

# Check service status
systemctl status exchange-api
systemctl status nginx
systemctl status redis-server
```

**Database Maintenance:**
Perform regular database maintenance including index optimization, data cleanup, and performance tuning.

```python
# Database maintenance script
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pymongo

class DatabaseMaintenance:
    def __init__(self, client):
        self.client = client
        self.db = client.exchange_forecast
    
    def cleanup_old_data(self, days_to_keep=90):
        cutoff_date = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=days_to_keep)
        
        # Clean up old exchange rate data
        result = self.db.exchange_rates.delete_many({
            'timestamp': {'$lt': cutoff_date}
        })
        print(f"Deleted {result.deleted_count} old exchange rate records")
        
        # Clean up old news articles
        result = self.db.news_articles.delete_many({
            'timestamp': {'$lt': cutoff_date}
        })
        print(f"Deleted {result.deleted_count} old news articles")
    
    def optimize_indexes(self):
        # Rebuild indexes for better performance
        collections = ['exchange_rates', 'news_articles', 'predictions']
        for collection_name in collections:
            collection = self.db[collection_name]
            collection.reindex()
            print(f"Reindexed {collection_name} collection")
    
    def generate_maintenance_report(self):
        report = {
            'timestamp': datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            'database_stats': {},
            'collection_stats': {}
        }
        
        # Database statistics
        db_stats = self.db.command('dbStats')
        report['database_stats'] = {
            'collections': db_stats['collections'],
            'data_size': db_stats['dataSize'],
            'storage_size': db_stats['storageSize'],
            'indexes': db_stats['indexes']
        }
        
        # Collection statistics
        for collection_name in ['exchange_rates', 'news_articles', 'predictions']:
            collection = self.db[collection_name]
            stats = self.db.command('collStats', collection_name)
            report['collection_stats'][collection_name] = {
                'count': stats['count'],
                'size': stats['size'],
                'avg_obj_size': stats.get('avgObjSize', 0)
            }
        
        return report
```

## Backup and Recovery

Comprehensive backup and recovery procedures are essential for protecting against data loss and ensuring business continuity. This section outlines backup strategies and recovery procedures for all system components.

### Database Backup

**MongoDB Atlas Automated Backups:**
MongoDB Atlas provides automated backup services with point-in-time recovery capabilities. Configure backup retention policies and test recovery procedures regularly.

```python
# Backup verification script
import pymongo
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

class BackupManager:
    def __init__(self, atlas_client):
        self.client = atlas_client
        self.db = atlas_client.exchange_forecast
    
    def create_manual_backup(self):
        # Create a manual backup snapshot
        backup_name = f"manual_backup_{datetime.utcnow().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"
        
        # Export critical collections
        collections_to_backup = ['exchange_rates', 'news_articles', 'predictions', 'model_performance']
        backup_data = {}
        
        for collection_name in collections_to_backup:
            collection = self.db[collection_name]
            backup_data[collection_name] = list(collection.find({}))
        
        # Save backup data to file
        import json
        backup_file = f"/backup/{backup_name}.json"
        with open(backup_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(backup_data, f, default=str)
        
        return backup_file
    
    def verify_backup_integrity(self, backup_file):
        # Verify backup file integrity
        try:
            with open(backup_file, 'r') as f:
                backup_data = json.load(f)
            
            # Verify all expected collections are present
            expected_collections = ['exchange_rates', 'news_articles', 'predictions']
            for collection in expected_collections:
                if collection not in backup_data:
                    return False, f"Missing collection: {collection}"
                
                if not backup_data[collection]:
                    return False, f"Empty collection: {collection}"
            
            return True, "Backup integrity verified"
        except Exception as e:
            return False, f"Backup verification failed: {str(e)}"
```

**Application Code Backup:**
Implement version control and automated backup procedures for application code and configuration files.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Application backup script

BACKUP_DIR="/backup/application"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
BACKUP_NAME="app_backup_$DATE"

# Create backup directory
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME"

# Backup application code
cp -r /opt/exchange-forecast "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/"

# Backup configuration files
cp -r /etc/nginx/sites-available/exchange-forecast "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/"
cp /etc/systemd/system/exchange-*.service "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/"

# Backup environment files
cp /opt/exchange-forecast/backend/.env "$BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME/"

# Create compressed archive
cd "$BACKUP_DIR"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_NAME.tar.gz" "$BACKUP_NAME"
rm -rf "$BACKUP_NAME"

# Clean up old backups (keep last 30 days)
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "app_backup_*.tar.gz" -mtime +30 -delete

echo "Application backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR/$BACKUP_NAME.tar.gz"
```

### Disaster Recovery

**Recovery Procedures:**
Document step-by-step recovery procedures for different failure scenarios including database corruption, server failures, and complete system disasters.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Disaster recovery script

RECOVERY_TYPE=$1
BACKUP_FILE=$2

case $RECOVERY_TYPE in
    "database")
        echo "Starting database recovery..."
        # Stop application services
        sudo systemctl stop exchange-api
        sudo systemctl stop exchange-celery
        
        # Restore database from backup
        mongorestore --uri="$MONGODB_URI" --archive="$BACKUP_FILE"
        
        # Restart services
        sudo systemctl start exchange-api
        sudo systemctl start exchange-celery
        
        echo "Database recovery completed"
        ;;
    
    "application")
        echo "Starting application recovery..."
        # Extract backup
        tar -xzf "$BACKUP_FILE" -C /tmp/
        
        # Stop services
        sudo systemctl stop exchange-api
        sudo systemctl stop nginx
        
        # Restore application files
        sudo cp -r /tmp/exchange-forecast/* /opt/exchange-forecast/
        
        # Restore configuration
        sudo cp /tmp/exchange-forecast /etc/nginx/sites-available/
        sudo cp /tmp/exchange-*.service /etc/systemd/system/
        
        # Reload systemd and restart services
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl start exchange-api
        sudo systemctl start nginx
        
        echo "Application recovery completed"
        ;;
    
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {database|application} <backup_file>"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

**Business Continuity Planning:**
Develop comprehensive business continuity plans that address various disaster scenarios and define recovery time objectives (RTO) and recovery point objectives (RPO).
